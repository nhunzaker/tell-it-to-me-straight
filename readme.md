# Tell it to me straight

## How to run this thing

The `package.json` file has a `scripts` property, you can use that to do things like:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

That'll install dependencies, then start Webpack, which builds your javascript. It is configured in `webpack.config.js`. Open `index.html` in your browser. It'll watch for changes.
